![alt text](/client/src/components/layout/caravanlogo.png "Logo Title Text 1")

This was an experiment website I designed/developed for one of my client whose major goal was to generate conversion.

This website was designed with UX in mind to lead conversion through SEM, and is not optimzed for SEO

```
npm install on '/'
```

```
npm install on '/client'
```

```
npm run dev
```

The above command will start the MERN environment, It starts `port 3000` for react and `port 5000` for node/express, you can enter your email in `/config/keys_dev` , then when you submit any form, you'll get the form data in your email
