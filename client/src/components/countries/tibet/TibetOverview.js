          para1=" Tibet or Tibet Autonomous Region of China is located on the Tibetan plateau. It’s is also known as the Roof of the World because of its geographic proximity. It is the highest region in the world with an average elevation of 4,900 meters.

The desert like landscape and harsh weather condition makes Tibet mostly inhabitable; however, the local tribesmen have survived for millenniums in the same condition, therefore, giving birth to their unique culture, lifestyle and art. The first Tibetan empire was founded by King Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century by annexing smaller kingdoms."
          para2="Spanned across 1.228 million km², the Greater Tibet region is home to ancient East Asian cultures, history and varying natural landscapes. The southern terrains are covered with high towering Himalaya peaks. Most lakes and rivers originate in Tibet and pass down towards the South Asian nations. These qualities make it a unique destination for travel.

Lhasa, Everest Base Camp (North), Kailash and Mansarovar are some of the worth visiting places inside Tibet. During the Tibet overview tour, you get to visit and briefly explore handful of provinces of Tibet, namely; Nyalam, Gyantse, Shigatse and  Lhasa."
          para3=" The first detailed exploration of Tibet came from the adventurer Heinrich Harrer and his travelogue, “7 Years in Tibet.” Heinrich, along with his friend, entered Lhasa in a disguise. He was later instated as the tutor of the 14th Dalai Lama."
