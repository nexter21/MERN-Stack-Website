The monastery is over 100 years old and the popular Mani Rimdu festival is held every year to commemorate its legacy. Few other Sherpa villages you’ll come across are Dingboche and Lobuche. From here, the trail ascends towards Everest Base Camp through Gorakshep. A day tour is enough to see around the base camp and return to Gorakshep to prepare for the next day hike to the Kala Patthar.Sagarmatha National Park, Kala Patthar, Jungle Safari inside Chitwan National Park and the tour of ethnic villages are the highlights of this trip. You must be prepared to endure the sheer warmth of the southern basins during the trip."
