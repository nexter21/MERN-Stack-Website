          para1="Lobuche Peak or Lobuje is one of the highest trekking peaks in Nepal. It is known to have two distinct summits, Lobuche East (6,119 m) and Lobuche West. Most climbs are perfomed at the Lobuche East. In order to climb the Lobuche West, you would need an Expedition permit."
          para2="Among the trekking peaks in Nepal, Lobuche East is accounts for the most technical climbing, even if it is only at the mere altitude of 6,119 meters. It is a challenging climb and offers some great scenery of the surrounding Eight-Thousander peaks. It contains steep and slippery rocks slabs and snow slopes to reach south west ridge, which is just below the glacier, which is along the high camp"
          para3=" The final climb is sharp with exposed ridge.The first recorded ascent of the Lobuche Peak was made by Laurence Nielson and Sherpa Ang Gyalzen on 25 April, 1984. Most trekkers climb the summit ridge only as far as a subsidiary snow summit, before the notch, south-east of the true peak. While climbing the East Peak, you need to be careful of the false summits."
