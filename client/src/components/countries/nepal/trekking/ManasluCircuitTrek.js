Formerly, a camping trip, it can now be completed through tea-houses en route."

The trek commences at Arughat, Gorkha"
          para3=" The 13 days trekking passes through many uneven terrains and varying geographical conditions. The highest elevation you will reach is at Larkya La Pass at the sheer height of 5,160 meters. It concludes at Syange village.Manaslu Circuit Trek is one of the best longest treks in the world. It receives a lesser amount of tourists in a year compared to the Everest and Annapurna region, hence, the trail remains wide open for exploration. Manaslu Conservation Area (MCAP) is the highlight of the trek which offers a rare glimpse of mid-western flora and fauna. You would be required to obtain a permit to enter the region."
