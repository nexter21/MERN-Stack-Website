                  para1="A former kingdom of Lo, Mustang is a discreet region located in the western Nepal and bordering with the Tibet in the North. It is one of the rain-shadow areas, therefore, tourists can visit the region throughout the year.The trek begins from Jomsom, after a brief flight from Pokhara. The first stop is made at the iconic Kagbeni."
                  para2=" From here, the trails ascends. The walled city of Lo Manthang is the major stop during the trek. You get to witness the local lifestyle, art, culture and accommodation at Lo Manthang"
                  para3=" An extra day is kept for you to explore the walled city and the outskirts. The trail descends until Jomsom, where you can catch your flight back to Kathmandu via Pokhara; along with a bottle or two of Marpha, a locally prepared apple wine.Lo Manthang is the capital of Upper Mustang. Before it was conceded with Nepal, it was an independent nation. The last monarch of the region still resides in his palace inside Lo Manthang, and if you’re lucky, you might get to meet him as well. The desert-like landscape and Buddhist relics may give a feel like you’re traveling through Tibet, which are the major attractions of the trek. Come prepared to ride a mule for the local journey."
                  itineraryes={[[["Arrival in Kathmandu"],["\nAt your arrival in Kathmandu, a member of our team will greet and receive you at the airport. You will be transferred to your hotel. Our representative will brief on your arrival about the trip. The rest of the day is yours. The evening we be spent enjoying complimentary local dinner one of the finest local diner with cultural program."]],[["Kathmandu Sightseeing"],["\nThe sightseeing tour of Kathmandu with the best tourist guide of the town will offer you a chance to visit Pashupatinath- the largest Hindu Temple of Nepal. After the exploration of Pashupatinath you will walk along the busy streets of Kathmandu to Boudhanath. A large domed shaped Buddhist stupa, Boudhanath holds huge religious significance among the Tibetan Buddhists of Nepal. After a heavy lunch, the tour will advance to the Patan Durbar Square. The exemplary wooden and stone craftsmanship at the site makes a place the prominent attraction for tourists and shows the historical side of the Malla kingdom and Newari lifstyle. The tour will end with a serene trip to Swayambhunath, the most important landmark of Buddhism in Nepal."]],[["Drive to Pokhara"],["\nWe take the 6-7 hours long ride to Pokhara in a tourist bus. You can spoend the rest of the day wander lusing at the lakeside."]],[["Fly to Jomsom & Trek to Kagbeni"],["\nThe spectacular early morning flight will take you to Jomsom. From here, you begin your trek. Just out of Jomsom you cross a small suspension bridge and then walk along the riverbank of the Kali Gandaki. The trail is flat and quite barren, with craggy rocks and sand littering the trail. This makes it very easy going. At the north end of the Upper Mustang village is the police check-post. Here we will complete our paperwork before entering this long forbidden region of Nepal."]],[["Trek to Chhuksang"],["\nIt is possible to trek right up the river valley, but we use a combination of the high trail and the riverbank pathways. The trail then widens significantly revealing an endless stretch of sand but the path is kept interesting by the passing of mule trains bearing goods from Mustang and Tibet. On the west bank of the river are some caves and Gompa Kang. Unlike most monasteries in Upper Mustang which are of the Sakyapa sect, Gompa Kang is of the Nyingmapa sect. Chhuksang village is only about 2hrs walk beyond Tangbe at the confluence of the Narshing Khola and the Kali Gandaki."]],[["Trek to Samar"],["\nThere is a distinct change here, not only in the topography, but also in the culture, lifestyle and people, and the settlements become more scattered, smaller and more basic. The people of Lo or Mustang practice agriculture. But due to lack of rain and fertile soil, cultivation is limited to sheltered plots of land. This spots the brown landscape with patches of green. Continuing north, we reach the river. A steel bridge spans the river just in front of a tunnel and north from here the Kali Gandaki becomes impassable by foot. The trek now leaves the valley and climbs steeply up a rocky gully to the village of Chele."]],[["Trek to Geling"],["\nWe climb above Samar to a ridge and then descend into a large gorge past a Chorten before entering another valley filled with juniper trees. We then cross a stream and after climbing to a pass, we descend along a ridge to Shyangmochen, a tiny settlement with a few tea shops. Nearby is Rangbyung, a cave containing stalagmites which have formed in the shape of Chorten and one of the holiest places in Mustang. The trail climbs gently from Shyangmochen and we enter another huge valley before."]],[["Trek to Ghami"],["\nFrom Geling, the trail climbs gently through fields, up the center of the valley, passing above the settlement of Tama Gun and an imposing Chorten. We then begin a taxing climb across the head of the valley to the Nyi La [3840m]. The descent from the pass is quite gentle and about half an hour further on we come to a trail junction; the right trail is the direct route to Charang, the left trail leads to Ghami. Ghami is a large white-washed village sheltered by overhanging cliffs."]],[["Trek to Charang"],["\nToday’s walk is through perhaps the driest part of Mustang, and much of our energy will be spent negotiating the loose, dry soil. However, the magnificent views of the countryside, from the gentle contours of the north to the rugged mountains in the east and west, more than compensates for the hard climb. Finally, we come to Charang, a large spread-out village at the top of the Charang Chu canyon. At the eastern end of the village are a huge dzong [fortress] and a red gompa which houses an excellent collection of statues and thangkas."]],[["Trek to Lo Manthang"],["\nWe will spend part of the morning exploring the interesting village of Charang and its large monastery, before setting out for Lo Manthang. We climb gently above the valley to a large isolated Chorten that marks the boundary between Charang and Lo Manthang. The trail then broadens and eventually we get our first view of the walled city of Lo Manthang. The city has only one entrance so we circumambulate the wall to the gate on the north-east corner."]],[["In & Around Lo Manthang"],["\nToday, you are free to explore the fascinating city of Lo Manthang. The city contains about 150 houses, as well as residences for its many lamas. There are four major temples within the city and one of these, Champa Lhakang, contains a huge clay statue of Buddha as well as elaborates mandalas painted on the walls. The king’s palace is an imposing building in the center of the city and is occupied by the current King and Queen. Although his duties are largely ceremonial, the King is respected by the people. Throughout the kingdom, the villagers continue to seek his advice regarding many issues. It is possible to hire horses to visit these valleys, but this short tour will incur extra costs."]],[["Trek to Gekar"],["\nWe begin our return journey from Lo Manthang, taking the upper highland route. This highland route offers dramatic views of Lo Manthang and the Charang Valley, with snow clad peaks in the background. Just past the settlement of Lo Gekar, we reach the oldest monastery in Mustang, the Ghare Gompa."]],[["Trek to Ghami"],["\nWe continue our journey on the highland route, crossing alpine meadows before dropping down a steep eroded gully to Dhakmar for lunch. After lunch, we walk through the pretty valley, climb to a ridge and descend from there back to Ghami."]],[["Trek to Chhuksang"],["\nNow we must retrace our route back over the Nyi La to Chhuksang."]],[["Trek to Jomsom"],["\nIt’s a long and sad final day, passing back through Kagbeni to Jomsom where we end our trek. It’s now time for us to take a nice hot shower. In the evening, we celebrate with the Sherpas and porters, whom we have come to know so well over the last 2 weeks."]],[["Fly to Kathmandu via Pokhara"],["\nWe take a spectacular early morning flight along the Kali Gandaki gorge to Pokhara and catch a connecting flight back to Kathmandu."]],[["Depart from Kathmandu"],["\nYou will be transferred to the Airport to catch your flight back home."]]]}
