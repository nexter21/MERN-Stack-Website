          para1="This basically is a short trek to Everest. Unlike most other treks, this trip offers an entire insight into the Khumbu region at shorter time. You will get an opportunity to view some of the most popular mountains in the region, namely; Mount Everest, Lhotse, Ama Dablam and Makalu. The 11 Days guarantees best time ever."
          para2="The trek begins at Lukla, a small airport town in Khumbu. The trail ascends to Namche Bazaar through Phakding. Namche Bazaar is the highlight of the trek"
          para3=" A most populated Sherpa town is known for its open market, luxurious or budget lodges and ethnic lifestyle. It ascends further to Khumjung, a smaller but richer Sherpa village. The highest most leg of the trek, Tengboche, boasts the highest monastery on Earth. It is thought to be over 100 years old and the popular Mani Rimdu festival is held every year to commemorate its legacy. It offers one of the most panoramic view of the entire Everest region.A day tour is enough to see around the place and descend to Pangboche the other day. Afterwards, it’s all descents. Chumoa village followed by Lukla is the final leg of the trek. Sagarmatha National Park is the highlight of the trek which offers a rare glimpse of Himalayan flora and fauna."
