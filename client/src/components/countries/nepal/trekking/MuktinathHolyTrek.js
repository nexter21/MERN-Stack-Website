                  para2=" Hindus call the sacred place ‘Mukti Kshetra,’ which literally means the “place of liberation or moksha.”During the holy month, primarily September/October, the pilgrims make a visit to the temple every year. If you’re lucky, you could trace the holy trail with them and enjoy the outdoors"
                  para3="The courtyard of temple has 108 Bull-faced spouts pouring out cold water. Pilgrims, making a visit to the temple, must also consider taking a shower under every spout for the ‘soul cleansing’ purpose. You can find a locally produced wine made from the apples, Marpha, in and around Jomsom. It’s quite popular among the locals and tourists alike."
