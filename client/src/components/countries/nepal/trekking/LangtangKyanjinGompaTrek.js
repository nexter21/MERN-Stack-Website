          para3=" Kyanjin Gompa is a Buddhist religious site and a major stop during the trek. The next day, an early morning hike to Tsergo Ri will offer a best time of the trip. From here, the trail descends all the way to Syabrubesi.Langtang Trek is suitable for all kinds of hikers. You must be accompanied by a guide to enter the region.
