            <strong>
              Tourism should be planned and practiced as a privileged means of
              individual and collective fulfillment; when practiced with a
              sufficiently open mind. It is an irreplaceable factor of
              self-education, mutual tolerance and for learning about the
              legitimate differences between people, cultures and their
              diversity.

          <p>
            LGBT rights were legitimized by the state of Nepal in 2007.
            Sanctioned and protected by the law, you can freely enjoy most of
            the LGBT rights in Nepal than any other countries around the world.
            Nepal Tourism Board has already green-flagged the program to
            encourage LGBT tourism; therefore, Nepal can be a desirable
            destination for the global LGBT tourists.
