              <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                Our treks are suitable for average people who are moderately
                fit, thus no previous experience is required. Some physical
                fitness programs such as running, swimming, hiking is
                recommended before you embark on your journey. Whilst on the
                trek, it is common to experience some discomfort before being
                fully acclimatized.
              </p>
              <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                To prepare for a strenuous trek you should begin training at
                least two to three months before your departure. As a guideline,
                an hour of aerobic exercise three to four times per week would
                be considered a minimum requirement. The best preparation is
                bush-walking involving relatively steep ascents and descents.

              </p>
              <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                One of the most unpredictable elements of the trekking is the
                local weather. If you’re not properly prepared for the twists,
                turns and volatility of the conditions that can occur in this
                breathtaking region, you might find yourself in an uncomfortable
                and unpleasant situation.

              <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                Generally speaking, the nights are much cooler than the daytime
                hours. During the day, the thermometer could reach temps as high
                as 25 degrees C, only to dip down as low as -20 degrees C in
                less than 24 hours. While there’s no way to know exactly what
                each day in the mountains will bring, the weather and
                temperature ranges tend to be somewhat predictable based on the
                month and season.

              <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                Not at all. It’s better, actually. Most of the lodges serve
                vegetarian meals. We always recommend our clients to eat
                vegetarian meals to avoid the food poisoning, eating heavy meals
                and non- vegetarian meals at the high altitude
                <br />
                is not really safe for the stomach.

              <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                It depends on your spending habits. Generally, in Kathmandu, you
                can allocate USD 10 to USD 15 for a lunch and a dinner. USD 15
                to USD 18 per person a day will be enough to buy chocolates, pay
                for the hot shower and a few drinks during the trekking.

              <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                This is a difficult thing to gauge. We have seen everything from
                USD 20 to USD 1000 per person for guides and porters.
              </p>
              <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                Tipping is not mandatory; however, you can choose to offer them
                money as a small gesture of appreciation. Most of the staff hail
                from low waged family or fragile financial conditions,
                therefore, your gesture can help them a lot in their cause. We
                recommend not to spend more than 10% of your total trip cost for
                the tipping.

                The temperature ratings of the sleeping bags we provide are
                about -10°C to -15°C, we can provide liner or extra blanket if
                the sleeping bag is not warm enough for you.

                Yes, we do have PAC but we don’t use it for every trek, unless
                you only have to stay a night above 5,000 meters.
