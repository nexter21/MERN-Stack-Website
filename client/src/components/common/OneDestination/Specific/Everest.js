        </p>
        <h2>TREKKING APPROCH TO EVEREST BASE CAMP</h2>
        <p>
          Our approach to base camp trekking begins with a spectacular mountain
          flight to Lukla (gate way of Everest region). Once we reach there, it
          takes us couple of hours to manage the porters and start walking alone
          with the Milk River (Dudh Koshi) for 2-3 hours from here we begin our
          trek to Everest base camp and reach to a small village call Phakding
          (2625m) where you are going to spend your first night in Everest area.
          Next day trek to Namche (9,000ft), which lies at the base of the
          Khumbu Himal.. The trek will take approximately 10 days and travels
          from the Dudh Koshi valley up through the Imja Drangka and finally
          onto the Khumbu glacier. Along the way we will visit the cities of
          Namche, Tengpoche, Pheriche and Lobuche, all of which are fascinating
          and richly cultured villages, which provide spectacular views of the
          Himalayas. For acclimatization purposes, this trek is longer than
          usual. This also gives us the chance to explore the many different
          areas and take the time to visit local monasteries and visit with
          Nepali Sherpa friends.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Base camp is located at 17,500 feet. This is where climbers begin
          their true trip up the mountain. This is also where support staff
          often remains to monitor the expeditions and provide medical
          assistance when necessary. Many organizations offer hiking trips which
          just go to base camp as the trip is not technically challenging
          (though you must be very fit).{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          From base camp, climbers typically train and acclimate (permitting the
          body to adjust to the decreased oxygen in the air) by traveling and
          bringing supplies back and forth through the often-treacherous Khumbu
          Icefall. This training and recuperation continues throughout the
          climb, with the final summit push often being the only time to
          climbers do not go back and forth between camps to train, bring
          supplies, and recuperate for the next push.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The Icefall is in constant motion. It contains enormous ice seracs,
          often larger than houses, which dangle precariously over the climbers
          heads, threatening to fall at any moment without warning, as the
          climbers cross endless crevasses and listen to continuous ice creaking
          below. This often acts as a testing ground to judge if less
          experienced climbers will be capable of continuing. The Icefall is
          located between 17,500 and 19,500 feet.
        </p>
        <h2>IN & AROUND EVEREST BASE CAMP</h2>
        <p>
          Having years of experience helped us to establish the finest Base Camp
          in the mountain. With the highest quality tent structures and imported
          foods, we strive to insure the time at Base Camp is restful and
          revitalizing. By providing these accommodations, we make every effort
          to keep climbers healthy and rested.{" "}
        </p>
        <h2>CLIMBING ROUTE & HIGH CAMPS </h2>
        <p>
          By the time we reach base camp, our climbing leaders and Sherpa will
          be well on the way to having the lower part of the mountain (the
          Khumbu Ice Fall) already fixed with ropes and ladders. We will
          establish four camps on the mountain. The first, at 19,500ft, is
          situated at the top of the ice fall. This camp functions as an
          intermediate camp until Camp II (advanced base camp) is established at
          21,000ft. Camp II will consist of large tents for cooking and dining
          and several smaller tents for sleeping. Camp II will be our base
          during the placements of Camp III and Camp IV (23,500ft and 26,300ft
          respectively). Camp III, which stands at the head of the cirque on the
          Lhotse face will consist of three and four man tents. This camp serves
          as an intermediate camp which climbers will use to reach Camp IV (high
          camp) on the South Col. Most of our Sherpa are able to carry directly
          from Camp II to Camp IV, so large amounts of gear are not needed at
          Camp III to establish Camp IV. Oxygen will be used above Camp III to
          help aid climbers in reaching high camp before attempting the summit.
          From Camp IV, we travel along the South East Ridge to the South
          Summit. From here we traverse for a few hundred meters before reaching
          the Hillary step and then onto the main summit.{" "}
        </p>
        <h2>BRIEF INFORMATION OF THE HIGH CAMPS OF Mt. EVEREST </h2>
        <h3>Camp I - 5900 meters</h3>
        <p>
          After the Icefall, the climbers arrive at Camp I, which is located at
          19,500 feet. Depending on the type of expedition, Camp I will either
          be stocked by the climbers as they ascend and descend the Icefall, or
          by Sherpas in advance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The area between Camp I and Camp II is known as the Western Cwm. As
          the climbers reach Camp II at 21,000 feet, they may be temporarily out
          of sight of their support at Base camp. Nonetheless, modern
          communication devises permit the parties to stay in contact.
        </p>
        <h3>Camp II - 6500 meters</h3>
        <p>
          As the climbers leave Camp II, they travel towards the Lhotse face
          (Lhotse is a 27,920 foot mountain bordering Everest). The Lhotse face
          is a steep, shiny icy wall. Though not technically extremely
          difficult, one misstep or slip could mean a climber's life. Indeed,
          many climbers have lost their lives through such mishaps.{" "}
        </p>
        <h3>Camp III - 23,700 feet (7200 meters)</h3>
        <p>
          To reach Camp III, climbers must negotiate the Lhotse Face. Climbing a
          sheer wall of ice demands skill, strength and stamina. It is so steep
          and treacherous that many Sherpas move directly from Camp II to Camp
          IV on the South Col, refusing to stay on the Lhotse Face.
        </p>
        <h3>Camp IV - 26,300 feet (8000 meters)</h3>
        <p>
          As you’re leaving C4…it’s a little bit of a down slope, with the
          uphill side to the left. There are typically snow on the ledges to
          walk down on, interspersed with rock, along with some fixed rope. The
          problem with the rope is that the anchors are bad, and there’s not
          much holding the rope and a fall could be serious. Fortunately it’s
          not too steep, but there is a ton of exposure and people are usually
          tired when walking down from camp. The rock is a little down sloping
          to the right as well, and with crampons on, it can be bit tricky with
          any kind of wind. There’s a little short slope on reliable snow which
          leads to the top of the Geneva Spur, and the wind pressure gradient
          across the spur can increase there as you’re getting set up for the
          rappel. Wearing an oxygen mask here can create some footing issues
          during the rappel, because it’s impossible to see over the mask and
          down to the feet. For that reason, some people choose to leave Camp 4
          without gas, as it’s easier to keep moving down the Spur when it’s
          important to see all the small rock steps and where the old feet are
          going. Navigating down through all of the spaghetti of fixed ropes is
          a bit of a challenge, especially with mush for brains at that point.
          One lands on some lower ledges which aren’t so steep, where fixed
          ropes through here are solid. At this point, it’s just a matter of
          staying upright, and usually, the wind has died significantly after
          dropping off the Spur. The route turns hard to the left onto the
          snowfield that leads to the top of the Yellow Bands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Camp IV, which is at 26,300 on the Lhotse face, is typically the
          climbers' first overnight stay in the Death Zone. The Death Zone is
          above 26,000 feet. Though there is nothing magical about that
          altitude, it is at this altitude that most human bodies lose all
          ability to acclimate. Accordingly, the body slowly begins to
          deteriorate and die - thus, the name "Death Zone." The longer a
          climber stays at this altitude, the more likely illness (HACE - high
          altitude cerebral edema - or HAPE - high altitude pulmonary edema) or
          death will occur. Most climbers will use oxygen to climb and sleep at
          this altitude and above. Generally, Sherpas refuse to sleep on the
          Lhotse face and will travel to either Camp II or Camp IV.
        </p>
        <p>
          Camp IV is located at 26,300 feet. This is the final major camp for
          the summit push. It is at this point that the climbers make their
          final preparations. It is also a haven for worn-out climbers on their
          exhausting descent from summit attempts (both successful and not).
          Sherpas or other climbers will often wait here with supplies and hot
          tea for returning climbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          From Camp IV, climbers will push through the Balcony, at 27,500 feet,
          to the Hillary Step at 28,800 feet. The Hillary Step, an over 70 foot
          rock step, is named after Sir. Edmond Hillary, who in 1953, along with
          Tenzing Norgay, became the first people to summit Everest. The Hillary
          Step, which is climbed with fixed ropes, often becomes a bottleneck as
          only one climber can climb at a time. Though the Hillary Step would
          not be difficult at sea level for experienced climbers, at Everest's
          altitude, it is considered the most technically challenging aspect of
          the climb.
        </p>
        <h2>SUMMIT ATTEMPTS</h2>
        <p>
          After Camps III and IV are established and all our supplies are in
          place, we return to Base Camp for a rest. At Base Camp we will
          organize our summit teams and prepare ourselves for summit attempts.
          Once we are ready, we return to Advanced Base. If good weather
          prevails we move the summit team to Camp III, on day 2/3. Day 3/4 will
          be summit day for the team. They will start very early that morning
          and attempt to reach the summit before mid-day. After the summit, they
          retreat back to the South Col and on to Camp III. Next day the team
          will back to camp II & base camp.
        </p>
        <p>
          As always, weather plays a major part in all actual summit attempts.
          We will try as many summit attempts as safely possible as our goal is
          to put the maximum number of people on the summit. Guides and Sherpa
          will accompany all summit attempts and oxygen will be used.{" "}
        </p>
        <h3>Summit - 29,028 feet (8848 meters)</h3>
        <p>
          Once the climbers ascend the Hillary Step, they slowly and laboriously
          proceed to the summit at 29,028 feet. The summit sits at the top of
          the world. Though not the closest place to the sun due to the earth's
          curve, it is the highest peak on earth. Due to the decreased air
          pressure, the summit contains less than one third the oxygen as at sea
          level. If dropped off on the summit directly from sea level
          (impossible in reality), a person would die within minutes. Typically,
          climbers achieving the great summit will take pictures, gain their
          composure, briefly enjoy the view, then return to Camp IV as quickly
          as possible. The risk of staying at the summit and the exhaustion from
          achieving the summit is too great to permit climbers to fully enjoy
          the great accomplishment at that moment.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          As most readers of this page know, the return trip can be even more
          dangerous than the climb to the summit
        </p>
        <h2>OUR SUMMIT ATTEMPT STRETEGY BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCES </h2>
        <p>
          We start our Expedition journey after landing an air craft at Lukla
          air port. We do the trekking to Everest base camp slowly &
          acclimatizing with Himalaya’s weather. It approx takes 7 days to get
          in Everest base camp one way. Couple of nights rest & acclimatized on
          the foot of the Mt Everest then after we start our climbing courses
          all most for 5-6 week. 6-7 week days, depending upon the summit
          window, summit attempt can be charge. Therefore we will suggest you to
          take advices & discussion with your personal sherpa + team members of

        <h2>EXPERIENCE & SKILL REQUIRED TO BE A EXPEDITION MEMBER</h2>
        <p>
          We are looking for experienced climbers, for whom Everest is the next
          logical step in their climbing careers. Our team will be in top
          physical condition and ready to meet the extreme challenges Everest
          presents. If at all possible, we request that potential Everest
          climbers participate in one of our other domestic or international
          climbs. More over the participant must have the knowledge about the
          previous mountaineering expedition including the mountaineering skill
          development basic & advance trainings plus well shill to use climbing
          hard wear gears such as crampons, Jumars, prussiks, abseiling. Moving
          past knots, anchors etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important that a team member be able to work well with people
          and be willing to commit to a group effort which will last for several
          weeks. You will be exposed to a completely different culture during
          the expedition. An being the expedition team member, it is your
          responsibility to treat the people and their environment with respect.

          successful & safety summit attempt, some time on the tough climbing
          days, you may think, you have been away from home for an extended
          period of time is highly important. Be determined to finish what you
          have begin, trained for and set as a goal. Mountains are beautiful
          places but not every minutes of every day is sunshine & roses.
          Therefore while on the climbing the mountains focus on your goal & try
          to be mentally free. Our Sherpa support look after your requirements &
          guide you but you need to be honest and realistic with yourself and
          your team members.{" "}
        </p>
        <h2>WHY CLIMBING SHERPAS ARE ESSENTIAL IN THE HIMALAYAS</h2>
        <p>
          We committed to provide the most famous, experienced & profession high
          altitude climbing Sherpas. They have reached to the Mt Everest summit
          couple of times. To make the successful attempt on Mt Everest, there
          should have a good combination of various factors such as experienced
          team, strong & committed Sherpas team with nice, experienced cooking
          crew, very co operative to each other, good quality tents with
          accessories, quality foods etc therefore we provide you the best
          services in the industry. If you want to look over the climbing
          Sherpas previous climbing experiences then Will send you the details
          then you have the opportunity to choose the best personal Sherpa on
          your next expedition with us. As far as concern about our experiences
          to run smooth mountaineering expeditions to the Himalayas, We are
          success in our all most all the expedition trips. We run the trip
          especially to the Himalayas of Tibet & Nepal. The reason of our
          success in the mountaineering expeditions is due to the experienced
          Sherpa staffs, they are well trained, they knows the climbing routes,
          they knows how to make the climb safety, they have the knowledge about
          the rescue operation & technical part of the climbing etc. We provide
          personalize services during the climbing because our Sherpa ratio is
          1:1{" "}
        </p>
        <h2>EMERGENCY EVACUATION CONTROL SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>
          In case of emergency and at anytime during the expedition, company and
          its staff will use all the available resources to rescue and evacuate
          injured climbers to the finest doctor place soon as possible. From
          base camp or from the nearest point Gorekshep, MI 17 or smaller
          helicopter’s rescue is possible. Above base camp, an emergency
          situation can only be handled with the resources of the expedition and
          other expeditions in the area. Any additional cost involved in an
          emergency will be the responsibility of the climbing member(s)
          requiring immediate medical attention and/or evacuation. We
          recommended strong medical insurance policy which must covers the cost
          for Helicopter evacuation as well.
        </p>
        <h2>OXYGEN & SUGGESTED NUMBER OF OXYGEN TUBES</h2>
        <p>
          Oxygen & Mask regulator set is heart bit of the successful
          mountaineering expedition. Normally oxygen can be used above camp III.
          Yes of course there is several numbers of climbers who made the summit
          attempts without using the Oxygen’s. But without using the oxygen’s
          tubes during the climbing of big mountain is more risky. Therefore to
          meet our goal, we include standard number 5 tubes/bottles of 4 litters
          POISK oxygen into our package. We use POISK Russian oxygen, the brand
          is most reliable in the field of Himalayas mountaineering expedition.
          At the same time, if you are trying Mt Everest climbing for the first
          then we suggests to secure additional 3 tubes as your reserve
          emergency backup support, to secure the additional tubes, you must
          place the order with us in advance. Plus we provide well condition;
          brand new mask & regulator set (must be return after the expedition).
          We provide oxygen’s to your climbing Sherpa separately as mentioned in
          the package services.{" "}
        </p>
        <h2>COMMUNICATION & RADIO SYSTEM IN THE MOUNTAIN </h2>
        <p>
          Every climbing Sherpa, expedition guide & client will have a personal
          walkie talkie set. Your position will be monitored by the base camp
          manager (if arranged) or your guide, Sherpa who will be using the 65
          watt base station radio units, which can be also communicate between
          BC & ABC/ Camp II if required. Radios are for your safety & smooth
          running of the trip.
        </p>
        <h2>GENERAL MEDICAL FIRST AID KIT</h2>
        <p>
          We can prepare a general medical kit normally focusing to the Nepalese
          staff, therefore we strongly suggests to our client to have own
          personal medical kit where you can put as per your medical
          requirements and strongly recommend to consul with your personal
          doctor and check your fitness to go for trip.
