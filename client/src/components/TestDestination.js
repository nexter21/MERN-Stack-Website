          para1=" Voted one of the best long treks in the world, Annapurna
                    Circuit caters tourists with desire for adventure,
                    wilderness and sightseeing. The trail makes a complete round
                    of Annapurna mountain range; therefore, you can get the
                    iconic view of the Annapurna from almost every corner. You
                    must pass through four different regions during the trek;
                    Lamjung, Manang, Mustang and Myagdi. Lamjung and Myagdi of
                    the lower elevations are both predominantly Hindu region,
                    whereas, Manang and Mustang are Buddhist regions."
          para2="The total length of the Annapurna circuit route is almost
                    230 km (145 mi). The trek begins at Besishahar, a small
                    town. The trail slowly ascends and will reach up to 5,416
                    meters at Thorong La Pass, the highest elevation on the
                    trek. From here, the trail descends almost the entire way.
                    Muktinath and Marpha are two major stops. You can choose to
                    visit the holy Muktinath temple and enjoy some delicious
                    local Marpha wine (Apple wine) en route."
          para3=" Along with Annapurna base camp, it attracts over 120,000
                    trekkers in a year. Annapurna Conservation Area (ACAP) is
                    the highlight of the trek which offers a rare glimpse of
                    mid-western flora and fauna."
